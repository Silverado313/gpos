```

npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

3. Wait 2-3 minutes — you will see text scrolling. That is normal!

## Step 6: Create a Firebase Project

Firebase is the backend (database + login system) for the app. It is free.

### How to create a Firebase project:
1. Open your browser and go to: **https://console.firebase.google.com**
2. Sign in with your Google (Gmail) account
3. Click **"Create a project"**
4. Type a project name (e.g. `gposs-cx`) and click Continue
5. Turn **OFF** Google Analytics (not needed for dev)
6. Click **"Create project"** and wait a few seconds
7. Click **"Continue"** when ready

### Enable Authentication:
1. In the left menu, click **"Build"** then click **"Authentication"**
2. Click **"Get started"**
3. Click on **"Email/Password"** at the top of the list
4. Toggle the first switch **ON** (it turns blue)
5. Click **"Save"**

✅ You should see Email/Password with a green "Enabled" checkmark.

### Enable Firestore Database:

3. Leave everything as default and click **"Next"**
4. Select **"Start in test mode"**

## Step 7: Get Your Firebase Config

This is the connection code that links your app to Firebase.

### How to get it:
1. In Firebase Console, click **"Project Overview"** on the top left
2. Click **"+ Add app"**
3. Click the **"</>"** (Web) icon
4. Type `gpos` as the app nickname
5. Click **"Register app"**
6. You will see a config code block — keep this page open!

### Your Firebase Config looks like this:

```
apiKey: "AIzaSy..."
authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com"
projectId: "your-project-id"
storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com"
messagingSenderId: "123456789"
appId: "1:123456789:web:abc123"
```

## Step 8: Set Up the .env File

The `.env` file stores your Firebase credentials so the app can connect to Firebase.

### How to do it:
1. Open VS Code
2. Open the gpos folder: **File > Open Folder > Desktop > gpos > Select Folder**
3. In the left panel, find and click the **`.env`** file
4. Select all text inside: press **Ctrl + A**
5. Delete it: press **Delete** key
6. Paste your Firebase values in this format:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

7. Press **Ctrl + S** to save the file

> ⚠️ Never share your `.env` file — it contains secret keys. It is already in `.gitignore`.

## Step 9: Run the App Locally

### How to start the app:
1. Open CMD
2. Type this and press Enter:

```
cd Desktop\gpos
```

3. Type this and press Enter:

```
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

✅ You should see the GPOS login page!

## Step 10: Create Your Admin Account

After registering, your account will be "pending" by default. Follow these steps to make yourself an Admin.

### Register in the app:
1. Click **"Register"** on the login page
2. Fill in your name, email and password
3. Click Register — you will see a **"Pending Approval"** screen

### Approve yourself as Admin in Firebase:
1. Go to Firebase Console in your browser
2. Click **"Build"** > **"Firestore Database"**
3. Click on the **"users"** collection
4. Click on your user document (it shows your email)
5. Hover your mouse over `role: "pending"` — a pencil icon appears
6. Click the pencil icon
7. Delete `"pending"` and type `admin`
8. Click **"Update"**
9. Go back to the app and press **F5** to refresh

✅ You now have full Admin access to GPOS!
